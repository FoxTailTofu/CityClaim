## A plugin to help manage renting claim in Minecraft for my friend.

This plugins also use SQLite to store data about the price and duration per rent

### Plugin Dependency
- [ItsOuts](https://github.com/KiloCraft/ItsOurs)
- [DiamondEconomy](https://github.com/IAmSneak/diamond-economy/tree/main)

Note that I use modded version of DiamondEconomy, so it probably won't work by default and you have to adjust the code.
